##Unlocking Hidden Themes in Game of Thrones with Topic Modeling (LDA)

Just wrapped up a fun NLP project where I applied **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** to the *A Song of Ice and Fire* series (the book series behind *Game of Thrones*). 🐉⚔️

**The goal?** To uncover the latent topics hidden across the sprawling narrative and massive cast of characters.

📘 **About the Text**

Using text from Game of Thrones, I preprocessed the data (tokenized, removed stopwords, and normalized), and then ran LDA to extract themes based on word co-occurrence patterns.

🔍 **Topics & Interpretations**

Here are a few of the standout topics LDA identified:

🏹 **Topic 1: Power, Family, and Loyalty**

**Keywords:** lord, father, dany, robb, stark, drogo, king, khal, sansa, sword, joffrey, lady, jorah

**Interpretation:** Focuses on family relationships, leadership, and the clashing of noble houses, especially the Starks and Targaryens.

🌌 **Topic 2: The Wall, Night’s Watch, and Mysticism**

**Keywords:** eye, wall, watch, night, bran, beneath, wind, maester, black, feel, dark

**Interpretation:** Themes of mystery and darkness, centered around Bran’s transformation and life at the Wall.

🔥 **Topic 3: Emotional Journeys of Dany & Sansa**

**Keywords:** dany, drogo, khal, sansa, love, child, woman, mirri, sleep, life, wonder

**Interpretation:** Captures the emotional and personal evolution of Daenerys and Sansa — themes of love, loss, identity, and resilience.

👑 **Topic 4: Thrones, Power, and Brutality**

**Keywords:** sword, king, gold, tyrion, bronn, kill, cloak, knight, throne, death, raven

**Interpretation:** This one screams politics, war, and the deadly game for the Iron Throne, with Tyrion and Bronn in the mix.

💡 **Use Cases of Topic Modeling**
Beyond fantasy novels, topic modeling has powerful real-world applications:

✅ **Customer Feedback** – Discover key themes in product reviews or survey responses

✅ **Legal & Policy Docs** – Automatically classify large corpora of legal documents

✅ **Academic Research** – Group and summarize large volumes of research papers

✅ **News & Media** – Analyze evolving narratives across publications or events

✅ **Business Intelligence** – Mine insights from support tickets, emails, and reports

📚 Game of Thrones is rich with layers — LDA helped uncover thematic structures behind the narrative, offering a unique data-driven lens into Westeros. This method is equally powerful in real-world applications, from product analysis to content recommendation.
